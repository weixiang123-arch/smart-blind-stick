This project combines GPS tracking with an obstacle detection system to improve mobility support for visually impaired users. An ESP32 processes GPS data and uploads latitude, longitude, and a Google Maps link to Firebase for real time monitoring. Two ultrasonic sensors detect nearby obstacles. The first sensor activates a buzzer with a beeping rate based on distance, while the second sensor controls a vibration motor that increases intensity as objects move closer. An LDR manages automatic lighting by switching an LED during low light conditions. The system improves safety, awareness, and monitoring efficiency.
